He’s a writer and thinker with a line or two in his mind. He just got a new journal and is planning the first page. Thinking of lines, not paying attention to the lines on the road. For the first time he’s hopeful for the plans that he’s laid, and that hope is running into the lines in his head.<br /><br />He’s a good kid, but he’s had his dark streaks. He’s lost a lot of ink to the surface of paper, and he’s lost a lot of words to his instinct for poetry.<br />All alone, he contemplates self.<br />All alone, he fixes his health.<br /><br />Drunk driver meets rainy roads, our man can’t tell the future, so he doesn’t know to look.<br />Silver Cadillac, SUV, flips the Corolla, XSE.<br />His head is hurt, and his car’s in the ditch. It’s getting warmer, but he wants to sleep. Didn’t see the gas leaking, so he slept through the fire.<br /><br />When the paramedics arrive, they can’t ID the young man. The police report will say that he was gripping a leather bound journal when they pulled him from the wreckage. The journal was as badly burned and unrecognizable.<br /><br />The family knew days before they got the call from metro police. He never misses family dinner, and he hadn’t called in over four days.<br /><br />When they got to the morgue, laying on the table was,<br />A young dead boy and an empty journal.",
